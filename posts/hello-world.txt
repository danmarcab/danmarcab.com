Hi there! It's me, Daniel, a London based software engineer, and for the nth time I am trying
to start writing about things that interest me.

    description = This time for real! (Note this was posted in 2019)

The main subjects will be computing (programming languages, compilers, algorithms), generative art and who knows
what else.

These days I am excited with [Elm]{link| url=https://elm-lang.org/} (the reason I can touch frontend code after 8 years, this page is built with it)
and I am keen on learning a bit of [rust]{link| url=https://www.rust-lang.org/}. As a good project
I am thinking about writing a [CHIP8]{link| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8} emulator.

I will try to make posts concise and didactic, after all they say you only understand something
if you can teach it. Test me!

Stay tuned for more.
